# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to find a possible vacation getaway from a random list of cities.  These cities needed to meet certain criteria.  To do this, I created a list of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes.  I then took this information to find as many cities close to these randomly selected values and matched the cities to corresponding latitudes and longitudes.  I then pulled weather data from a weather website using an API.  I collected temperatures, cloudiness, wind speed, etc.  After I had a list of cities and their corresponding weather reports, I asked the user to enter a preferable high and low temperature.  This temperature was used as a filter for possible vacation destinations.  After the list was narrowed, I used an API from Google to search for hotels in the remaining cities.  Lastly, I presented a possible destination list consisting of 4 cities in Spain.
